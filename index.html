		<p><s>Here you can download polymc builds with cracked accounts support, for free!</s></p>
		<h1 style="color: red;">Attention!</h1>
		<p>PolyMC dev gone rogue, and started to kick out all members from GitHub, and probably going to put malware in it. Though build down there is safe, i dont recommend using it, use <a href="https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher">Prism Launcher</a>, or its fork with hacked accounts <a href="https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC">PollyMC</a> (dont confuse with PolyMC), as it is pretty much same, and even has more features than PolyMC.</p>
